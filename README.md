# Stupid Questions
We need to encourage programmers to ask **more** stupid questions. Here are some of my best that have turned into my favorite projects.

## Questions
- What does the inside of a PDF look like?
  - Can I add my own watermark to PDFs I create?
- If I have a `.mp3` file, could I Shazam the song to get metadata about the song?
- Can I have a computer solve the puzzles of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes?
  - How about the Centurion Project?
